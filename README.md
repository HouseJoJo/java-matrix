Matrix Class for Java

This is a class that represents Matrices used in Linear Algebra. This is written to supplement my studying for Linear Algebra. 

The main goals for this project are:
-Write a method that will calculate the row reduced echelon form of a matrix
-Have a method that prints the steps to find the RREF of a matrix
-Program a method for matrix multiplication
-Method to check if matrix multiplication is possible for two given matrices
-Write a method that calculates the inverse matrix of a given square matrix
